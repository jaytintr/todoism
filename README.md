# TODOISM
- This is a todo created by JavaScript. First I designed the HTML and CSS, then I add some icons and color. After that, I used JavaScript to select the DOM elements and add function to it such as clicks, and some animations.
- An app function by storing old data into the Local Storage for later use, you can store your todo tasks into your browser and the app will auto fetch it when you use it
